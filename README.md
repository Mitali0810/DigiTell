This is basically an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) which is used to detect Hand Written digits live. Handwritten character recognition is one of the practically important issues in pattern recognition applications. The applications of digit recognition includes in postal mail sorting, bank check processing, form data entry, etc. The heart of the problem lies within the ability to develop an efficient algorithm that can recognize hand written digits and which is submitted by users by the way of a scanner, tablet, and other digital devices. This paper presents an approach to off-line handwritten digit recognition based on different machine learning technique. The main objective of this paper is to ensure effective and reliable approaches for recognition of handwritten digits. Machine learning algorithm namely Support Vector Machine has been used for the recognition of the digits. 

Run perform Recognition Live if you have a webcam and detect your images

Run perform Recognition scanned if you have scanned images with digits writtten in it or you can also use 
sample_1.jpg or sample_2.jpg for scanning.
